# Customer-Behavior-at-Beta-Bank

Project Description:
Customers of Beta Bank are leaving the company: gradually, their numbers are decreasing every month. Bank employees realize that it would be more cost-effective for the company to focus on retaining their loyal existing customers rather than attracting new ones.

In this case, our task is to predict whether a customer will soon leave the bank or not. You have data related to the behavior of clients in the past and their history of contract terminations with the bank.
Create a model with the highest possible F1 score. To pass the review, you need a minimum F1 score of 0.59 for the test dataset.
Afterwards, you will make the necessary changes to your work and submit it for a second review.
Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 score.

Objective:
To predict whether a customer will soon leave the bank or not.

Work Steps:
1. Download and prepare the data.
Ensure you explain the logic you used during the preparation process.

2. Check the balance of each class.
Train your model without considering the imbalance. Briefly explain your findings.

3. Improve the model quality.
Ensure that you use at least two approaches to address class imbalance. Use the training and validation sets to find the best model and parameter set. Explain your findings briefly. Use the training set to select the best parameters. Enhance the model quality by considering class imbalance. Train several different models and find the best one.

4. Run the final testing.
